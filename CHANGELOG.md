## [2.0.3] - 2025-11-09

### Added
- **Browser Context Reuse**: Implemented browser context reuse for 6x performance improvement (Issue #55)
  - Browsers stay alive in pool and create isolated contexts per request
  - Reduces browser launch overhead from ~2000ms to ~300ms per scrape
  - Maintains complete isolation between requests (cookies, localStorage, session data)
- **NSFW Content Authentication**: Added MFC cookie authentication for NSFW content access (Issue #19)
  - Support for session cookie injection (PHPSESSID, sesUID, TBv4_Iden, TBv4_Hash)
  - Automatic navigation to MFC homepage before cookie setting
  - Enables access to age-restricted figure content
- **Browser Context Isolation Tests**: Added comprehensive tests to verify no data bleed between requests
  - Tests for cookie isolation across contexts
  - Tests for localStorage/session data isolation
  - Validates browser pool correctly manages context creation and cleanup

### Changed
- **Puppeteer Update**: Upgraded Puppeteer from 24.25.0 to 24.29.1
  - Bundles Chrome 141.0.7390.122
  - Resolves 5 HIGH severity CVEs (CVE-2025-11756, CVE-2025-12036, CVE-2025-11458, CVE-2025-11205, CVE-2025-11206)
- **Dockerfile Update**: Updated Chrome for Testing from 140.0.7339.207 to 141.0.7390.122
  - Explicitly downloads patched Chrome version
  - Ensures Docker builds use secure Chrome binary
- **Test Suite Refactoring**: Consolidated 5 fragmented test files into single comprehensive browserPool.test.ts
  - Removed duplicate tests and mock setup
  - Improved test organization and maintainability
  - Maintained 100% test coverage on core functionality

### Fixed
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Fixed 13 TypeScript errors related to browser and page null checks
  - Added proper null guards for `browser` and `page` objects
  - Fixed catch block type annotations
  - Removed obsolete `emergencyBrowserCount` property
- **Test Coverage**: Improved coverage on new code from 79.7% to 85%+
  - Added tests for environment detection (NODE_ENV, JEST_WORKER_ID)
  - Added tests for browser close with isConnected check
  - Added tests for null page handling
  - Added detailed cookie structure assertions
- **SonarCloud Quality Gate**: Resolved SonarCloud failure by achieving >80% coverage on new code
- **Secure Logging**: Implemented sanitization of sensitive data in logs (genericScraper.ts:431-451)
  - Added `sanitizeConfigForLogging()` helper function to redact MFC session cookies
  - Prevents exposure of PHPSESSID, sesUID, TBv4_Iden, TBv4_Hash in console logs
  - All sensitive values replaced with `[REDACTED]` in log output
  - Maintains safe config logging for debugging purposes

### Security
- **Chrome CVE Fixes**: Patched 5 HIGH severity Chrome vulnerabilities
  - CVE-2025-11756: Security bug fix

  - Addresses "Generic: Secure Error Handling" code analysis finding
  - Addresses "Generic: Secure Logging Practices" code analysis finding
  - Added comprehensive security tests to verify sensitive data never appears in logs

### Performance
- **6x Faster Scraping**: Browser context reuse reduces per-request overhead
  - Before: ~2000ms per scrape (browser launch + navigation)
  - After: ~300ms per scrape (context creation + navigation)

## Migration Guide

### Upgrading from 2.0.2 to 2.0.3

**No Breaking Changes** - This is a backward-compatible patch release.

**What's New:**
1. **Performance**: Automatic 6x speedup with browser context reuse
2. **NSFW Access**: Optional MFC authentication via config
3. **Security**: Patched Chrome CVEs

**Action Required:**
- None - just deploy and enjoy faster scraping!

**Optional Configuration:**
To enable NSFW content access, provide MFC session cookies:
```javascript
{
  mfcAuth: {
    sessionCookies: {
      PHPSESSID: 'your_session_id',
      sesUID: 'your_user_id',
      TBv4_Iden: 'your_iden',
      TBv4_Hash: 'your_hash'
    }
  }
}
```
